# this week, on _vivi's fixation projects,_

### vague framework:

1. create some dummy keyboard/gamepad input, presumably using SDL

in real time:
2. read midi input events
3. convert to controller events
4. send to _something_ Dolphin can pick up

in the grander scheme, i'll learn useful info about
* c++
* midi control (will be useful later i think)
* gamepad control (will potentially also be useful later)
