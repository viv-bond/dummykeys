# this week, on _vivi's fixation projects,_

### vague framework:

1. create some dummy keyboard/gamepad input, presumably using SDL

in real time:

2. read midi input events

3. convert to controller events

4. send to _something_ Dolphin can pick up

in the grander scheme, i'll learn useful info about

* c++

* midi control (will be useful later i think)

* gamepad control (will potentially also be useful later)
